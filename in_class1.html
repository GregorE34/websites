	<p>The page is static because while it is engaging it does not have any aspects that update without refreshing the page and doesn't seem to utilize any sort of database. I love the design and side-scrolling aspect of this website.  I think the starkness of the black and white really works. I'm immediately intrigued about the work they are doing.  </p>

	<p>This page is dynamic because I can add shows and bands to my list without refreshing the page. It utilizes a database to keep track of my choices. I like the functionality and the way it allows me to keep track of live music but I hate the editorial style.  I also find the design to just OK but appreciate how functional it is on mobile.  </p>
